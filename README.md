## JobMatch Alert System
is a real-time notification feature designed to instantly inform candidates about new job opportunities that align with their profiles.

Current Features:
Database Notifications
Candidates receive in-app alerts whenever a job matching their location and expected salary is posted.

Future Implementation:
Real-Time Updates via Pusher
Integration with Pusher will enable instant, real-time delivery of notifications without needing to refresh the page.

## Archive Old Jobs & Remove Unverified Users (Scheduled Tasks)

Scheduled tasks are defined in the project to automate:
- **Archiving job posts older than 30 days**
- **Removing unverified users**

In Development
You can manually run the Laravel scheduler:
```bash
php artisan schedule:run
```

In Production
In production, Laravel's scheduler must be triggered **daily** using a system-level cron job.
Add this to your systemâ€™s crontab to enable automatic scheduling:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Rate-limit
- **Applied to Login Attempts**
- **Applied to Candidate Job Application Submissions**

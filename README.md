Future Implementation:

## Archive Old Jobs & Remove Unverified Users (Scheduled Tasks)

Scheduled tasks are defined in the project to automate:
- **Archiving job posts older than 30 days**
- **Removing unverified users**

## In Development
You can manually run the Laravel scheduler:
- **php artisan schedule:run**

## In Production
In production, Laravel's scheduler must be triggered **daily** using a system-level cron job.
Add this to your systemâ€™s crontab to enable automatic scheduling:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
